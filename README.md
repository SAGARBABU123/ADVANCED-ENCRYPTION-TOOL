#Â ABOUTÂ PROJECT
The Advanced Encryption Tool is a Python-based application designed to provide secure encryption and decryption of files using the AES-256 algorithm. This tool ensures that sensitive data remains protected by encrypting files with a generated key and allowing secure decryption when needed. It includes a user-friendly interface and handles encryption and decryption efficiently.

Key Features
âœ… AES-256 Encryption â€“ Uses the industry-standard AES-256 algorithm to provide high-level encryption security.
âœ… File Encryption and Decryption â€“ Encrypt and decrypt files securely with a single key.
âœ… Key Generation â€“ Automatically generates a secure encryption key and stores it for later use.
âœ… User-Friendly Interface â€“ Simple command-line interface for easy operation.

How It Works
Key Generation

The tool generates a secure AES-256 key using the cryptography library.
The key is stored securely in a .key file for future use.
File Encryption

The user provides a file path and the encryption key.
The tool reads the file, encrypts the contents, and creates a new encrypted file with the .enc extension.
File Decryption

The user provides the encrypted file and the key.
The tool reads the encrypted file, decrypts the data, and restores the original file.
Technologies Used
Python â€“ Programming language
cryptography â€“ Python library for encryption and decryption
AES-256 â€“ Encryption standard for secure data protection
Deliverables
ðŸŽ¯ A robust encryption and decryption tool with a user-friendly interface.
ðŸŽ¯ Secure handling of sensitive data using advanced encryption standards.
